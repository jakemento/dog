  <h3>Running</h3>
  <p> my dog likes to run at the park and around my house like a madman. His tail wags like crazy when he sees the neighbor's cat. He barks at the mailman</p>
<h3>Eating</h3>
<p> My dog will eat anything except grapes. Weird, right? His favorite foods are</p>
  <ol>
    <li>kibbles n bits</li>
    <li>generic brand dog food</li>
    <li>treats/random things he finds in the woods</li>
  </ol>
